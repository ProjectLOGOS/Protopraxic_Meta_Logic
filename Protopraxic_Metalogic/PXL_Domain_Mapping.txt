PXL_DOMAIN_MAPPING

---

This document outlines cross-domain deployment applications for the Protopraxic Logic System.

1. THEOLOGY

• Coherent trinitarian metaphysics (𝕀₁, 𝕀₂, 𝕀₃)
• Model divine attributes: truth, love, glory
• Exclude incoherent theological models (strict monism, modalism)

2. METAPHYSICS

• Necessity grounded in interdependent identities
• Filters contingent vs essential attributes
• Eliminates brute facts via modal entailment and triune grounding

3. EPISTEMOLOGY

• Coherence theory of truth formalized via ⧟, ⇌, ⩪
• Knowledge: □(Belief ∧ Grounded ∧ Coherent)
• Rejects relativistic models lacking modal coherence

4. ETHICS

• Goodness = identity-preserving coherence (⧟)
• Evil = ∼Coherence = Privation
• Moral realism derivable via □(𝕆 ⟼ Good)

5. AESTHETICS

• Beauty = modal balance (⇌)
• Fragmentation → aesthetic incoherence → evaluative decay
• Groundable beauty defined as that which instantiates triune harmony

6. LOGIC SYSTEMS

• Completes gaps left in classical logic (LEM, contradiction scope)
• Distinct symbol set prevents category bleed with Aristotelian/MF logics
• Suitable as a coherence-checking overlay for any modal predicate domain
