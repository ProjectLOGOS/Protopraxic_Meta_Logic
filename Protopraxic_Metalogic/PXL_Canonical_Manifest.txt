# PXL Canonical Packet Manifest
# Protopraxic Meta-Logic (PXL) - Constructive Modal Logic Completeness Kernel
# Generated: October 2, 2025
# Repository: Protopraxic_Meta_Logic (ProjectLOGOS)
# Phases: 1-5 Complete (Constructive, Axiom-Free Kernel)

## Overview
This packet contains the complete constructive implementation of modal logic completeness in Coq,
covering syntax, semantics, soundness, completeness, and decidability. All proofs are constructive
with no external axioms beyond the kernel Hilbert base (which are proven as lemmas).

## File Listing by Phase

### Phase 1: Foundations (Syntax and Basic Inductives)
- PXL_Foundations.v
  Purpose: Base inductives for modal logic syntax (forms, Prov rules), primitive operations.
  Dependencies: None
  Status: Constructive, complete

### Phase 2: Core (Soundness and Hilbert Machinery)
- PXL_Core.v
  Purpose: Meta-layer soundness proofs, Hilbert-style deduction system, modal axioms.
  Dependencies: PXL_Foundations.v
  Status: Constructive, complete

### Phase 3: Meta Validation (Canonical Models)
- PXL_Meta.v
  Purpose: Canonical model machinery, maximal consistent theories (MCT), accessibility relations.
  Dependencies: PXL_Core.v
  Status: Constructive, complete

### Phase 4: Completeness Kernel (Constructive Lindenbaum + Truth Lemma)
- PXL_Completeness_Truth_WF.v
  Purpose: Constructive Lindenbaum extension, truth lemma for modal logic completeness.
  Dependencies: PXL_Meta.v
  Status: Constructive, axiom-free (Hilbert base proven), complete
  Notes: Self-contained kernel; no instantiation files needed

### Phase 5: Decidability (Decision Procedures)
- PXL_Decidability.v
  Purpose: Decidability lemmas, decision procedures for modal logic.
  Dependencies: PXL_Completeness_Truth_WF.v
  Status: Scaffolded, structurally consistent

### Documentation
- PXL_Abstract.txt
  Purpose: High-level summary of PXL, grounding in constructive logic and paradox resolution.
  Phase: All

- PXL_Formal_Language_Definition.txt
  Purpose: Symbol key, grammar rules, formal language specification.
  Phase: All

- PXL_Domain_Mapping.txt
  Purpose: Domain scope, paradox mapping, meta notes on constructive foundations.
  Phase: All

- PXL_Paradox_Master.txt
  Purpose: List of paradoxes stress-tested and resolved in the system.
  Phase: All

## Build Instructions
1. Unzip PXL_Proof_Packet.zip
2. Ensure Coq 8.20+ is installed
3. Compile in order: PXL_Foundations.v -> PXL_Core.v -> PXL_Meta.v -> PXL_Completeness_Truth_WF.v -> PXL_Decidability.v
4. Run coqchk for hygiene verification

## Hygiene Verification
- coqchk -R . PXLs *.v : Should pass
- Print Assumptions truth_lemma. : Should report no assumptions
- No Axiom/Parameter/Admitted except in scaffolds
