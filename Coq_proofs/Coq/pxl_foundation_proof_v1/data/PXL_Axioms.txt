📘 Protopraxic Logic — Axiom and Symbol Suite

🔧 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Protopraxic Logic is a triune, modal, metaphysically grounded logic system that unifies identity, contradiction, and excluded middle under three interdependent hypostatic identities—𝕀₁, 𝕀₂, 𝕀₃—within a Necessary Being 𝕆. It incorporates:

- Modal operators (□, ◇)
- Custom PXL operators (⧟, ⇎, ⇌, ⟹, ∼, ≀, ⫴, ⟼, ⩪)
- Metaphysical grounding structured through triune coherence
- S5 modal frame

🧮 SYMBOL KEY
⧟ : Identity (self-coherence)
⇎ : Non-equivalence (exclusivity)
⇌ : Interchange (balance)
⟹ : Implication
∼ : Negation (non-coherence)
≀ : Conflation (misalignment)
⫴ : Dichotomy (excluded middle)
⟼ : Grounded entailment
⩪ : Modal coherence equivalence (triune parallelism)

📐 AXIOMS
A1. □(∀x [ x ⧟ x ]) — Law of Identity grounded in 𝕀₁
A2. □(∀x [ ∼(x ⧟ y ∧ x ⇎ y) ]) — Law of Non-Contradiction grounded in 𝕀₂
A3. □(∀x [ x ⫴ ∼x ]) — Law of Excluded Middle grounded in 𝕀₃
A4. □(Each law requires distinct modal instantiation across 𝕀₁, 𝕀₂, 𝕀₃)
A5. □(𝕆 = {𝕀₁, 𝕀₂, 𝕀₃}, co-eternal, co-equal, interdependent)
A6. □(𝕀₁ ⟼ Λ₁ ∧ 𝕀₂ ⟼ Λ₂ ∧ 𝕀₃ ⟼ Λ₃)
A7. □𝕆 — A triune Necessary Being is required for coherence in all possible worlds
