Abstract: Protopraxic Logic (PXL)
A Coherence-Driven, Modal-Axiomatic System for Grounding Identity, Truth, and Logical Necessity in Trinitarian Metaphysics

Protopraxic Logic (PXL) is a formally axiomatized, triune, modal logic system designed to unify the three classical laws of thought—Identity, Non-Contradiction, and Excluded Middle—within a rigorously grounded metaphysical architecture. PXL arose from a deductive lineage established in the Three Pillars Literature, which begins from an agnostic epistemic position, void of any theological assumptions, and progresses through pure logical necessity toward the affirmation of a Trinitarian metaphysical ground.

At its core, PXL is constructed on the premise that coherence itself must be modal, interdependent, and irreducibly relational. The system posits that the classical laws of thought are not independent axioms but modal necessities that require ontological grounding in a tri-personal necessary being (𝕆), consisting of three irreducible, co-eternal, co-equal identities: 𝕀₁, 𝕀₂, and 𝕀₃. Each of these identities grounds one of the three laws of logic, forming a closed, non-redundant, and interlocking structure.

PXL deploys a suite of custom-designed logical operators—including ⧟ (identity), ⇎ (non-equivalence), ⫴ (excluded middle), and ⩪ (triune modal equivalence)—intentionally distinct from traditional symbols to avoid confusion with classical or modern systems. It operates on an S5 modal frame but extends it with a metaphysical necessity clause that binds all logical laws to distinct hypostatic modalities.

The Three Pillars Literature, from which PXL emerged, follows a strict deductive methodology. It does not begin with theological assumptions; rather, it examines what logic itself demands in every possible world. The analysis reveals that logical coherence cannot be ontologically grounded in monadic, impersonal, or contingent structures. Only a triune structure—one that can mutually ground identity (𝕀₁), negate contradiction (𝕀₂), and uphold dichotomy (𝕀₃) without collapsing into modal incoherence—is sufficient. The final logical entailment is the existence of a Necessary Being with internally triadic identity: a finding consistent with, but not presupposing, Trinitarian metaphysics.

PXL has undergone extensive validation through the resolution of 124 historically significant paradoxes, spanning categories such as semantic antinomies, modal puzzles, theological dilemmas, quantum contradictions, and metaphysical regressions. Every paradox was reformulated within PXL’s operator set and successfully resolved without contradiction, circularity, or reliance on external systems. The framework further supports modal property classification (essential, contingent, privative), coherence testing, and inference filtration across metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic, theological, and scientific domains.

PXL functions not only as a logic system but also as a modal coherence engine—capable of analyzing the necessary structure of concepts such as truth, goodness, beauty, and glory, and distinguishing between their essential, derived, or privative forms.

In conclusion, Protopraxic Logic offers a fully formalized, theologically neutral but metaphysically complete logic system that begins from agnostic first principles and concludes with the necessary entailment of triune identity. It represents a substantial advancement in modal logic, metaphysics, and ontology—positioning itself as a high-coherence alternative to classical, intuitionistic, and paraconsistent systems, with cross-domain utility and maximal explanatory power.
